# MFB CMSBundle

This bundle offers some CMS functionality

 - Dynamic blocks: Include "templates" from DataBase anywhere on the page
 - Press releases: Kind of a "news" system for press releases. There is a "current" page which displays the newest release and an "archive" which contains a list of all past releases with the teaser content.
